  <div id="Dtwo1" class="dropdown-content2">
    <p>Yes, players who don't want to buy things from the Dota 2 Store will be able to earn them in a variety of ways, such as by simply playing the game, 
	increasing their Battle Level, or by trading with other players.</p>

  <div id="Dtwo2" class="dropdown-content2">
    <p>All of the heroes will be available free of charge. We believe restricting player access to heroes could be destructive to game design, so it's

<p><i>Half-Life is a series of first-person shooter games developed and published by Valve. The games combine shooting combat, puzzles, and storytelling.

  <div id="HL1" class="dropdown-content2">
    <p><b>The official order of the Half-Life games is as follows:</b>
     <ol>
	<li>Half-Life, or Half-Life: Source</li>
	<li>Half-Life: Opposing Force, Blue Shift, or Decay</li>
	<li>Half-Life 2</li>
	<li>Half-Life 2: Episode 1</li>
	<li>Half-Life 2: Episode 2</li>

	It is recommended you play the games in this order, however you can still enjoy any of the games if you haven't played the games that come before it.

  <button onclick="myFunction('HL2')" class="dropbtn2" id="dropbtn217">Will Half-Life Alyx Be VR-Only?<i class="arrow down"></i></button>
  <div id="HL2" class="dropdown-content2">
    <p>Unfortunately yes, youâ€™ll need a VR headset to play Half-Life: Alyx. The game was built from the ground up with VR in mind which means it doesnâ€™t even 
	include a traditional mouse/keyboard control option. The good news is that Half-Life: Alyx will be 
	<a href="https://www.newegg.com/VR-Headsets/SubCategory/ID-3629?Tid=241616/?cm_sp=GameCrate-_-Article-_-Alyx-_-NA">playable on all PC-compatible VR headsets</a> 
	including the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.</p>
    <p>If you were lucky enough to snag a Valve Index VR headset before Half-Life: Alyxâ€™s announcement caused a surge in sales and subsequent back order, 
	youâ€™ll actually get a copy of the game for free along with a few extra bonuses like unique in-game weapon skins.</p> 
  </div>
</div>
<div class="dropdown2">
  <button onclick="myFunction('HL3')" class="dropbtn2" id="dropbtn218">Is Half-Life: Alyx Coming To Other Platforms?<i class="arrow down"></i></button>
  <div id="HL3" class="dropdown-content2">
    <p>For the time being, Half-Life: Alyx will be PC-only. However, Valve has stated that it could invest further in the Half-Life property if Alyx winds up 
	being a success (which it most likely will be), so itâ€™s possible the game could eventually be ported over to other VR platforms like PlayStation VR. 
	Upcoming gaming consoles like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 will also likely have some sort of VR capability, so an eventual console port of 
	Half-Life: Alyx shouldnâ€™t be ruled out entirely.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="dropdown2">
  <button onclick="myFunction('HL4')" class="dropbtn2" id="dropbtn219">What Does Half-Life: Alyxâ€™s Story Entail?<i class="arrow down"></i></button>
  <div id="HL4" class="dropdown-content2">
    <p>Valve has been careful not to reveal too much about Half-Life: Alyxâ€™s story, but we do know a bit about whatâ€™s new and what fans of previous games 
	will assuredly recognize. As we previously mentioned, Alyxâ€™s story is a prequel set after the events of the original Half-Life but before the events of 
	Half-Life 2. Players control Alyx Vance as she works alongside her father Dr. Eli Vance to fight back against the oppressive Combine forces who seek to 
	subjugate humanity.</p>
	<p>Half-Life: Alyx will be set in City 17, the same location from Half-Life 2, and it will feature more than a few recognizable friends and foes. Along 
	with Alyx and her father, players will encounter iconic enemies like headcrabs and barnacles, and theyâ€™ll even cross paths with the enigmatic figure known 
	as G-Man.  </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="dropdown2">
  <button onclick="myFunction('HL5')" class="dropbtn2" id="dropbtn220">What Are Half-Life: Alyxâ€™s PC Requirements?<i class="arrow down"></i></button>
  <div id="HL5" class="dropdown-content2">
    <p>You wonâ€™t need a super-beefy PC to meet Half-Life: Alyxâ€™s minimum system requirements, but if your current gaming rig is more on the low or mid-range level, you might want to invest in a few upgrades. Half-Life: Alyxâ€™s minimum system requirements are as follows:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Operating System:</b> Windows 10</li>
	<li><b>Processor:</b> <a href="https://www.newegg.com/CPUs-Processors/Category/ID-34/?cm_sp=GameCrate-_-Article-_-Alyx-_-NA">Intel Core i5-7500 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600</a></li>
